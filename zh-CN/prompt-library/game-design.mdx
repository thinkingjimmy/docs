Prompt :

```
Design a vibrant game app interface titled 'AGI PoLang' with a soothing blue background featuring a lush landscape of towering trees and dense bushes framing the sides. At the heart of the screen, elegantly display the game's name in a golden, playful font that captivates attention. Beneath this, strategically place two interactive buttons labeled 'Play Game' and 'Quit Game', ensuring they are both visually appealing and user-friendly. Center stage, introduce an engaging scene where an orange wolf stands majestically on a verdant field, set against a serene blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The entire design should radiate a fun and playful atmosphere, encapsulating the spirit of adventure and joy that 'AGI PoLang' promises to deliver.
