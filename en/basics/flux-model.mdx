### 1.1 Model Versions

Flux model includes three versions, namely FLUX.1 Pro, FLUX.1 Dev, and FLUX.1 Schnell, to meet different usage scenarios and needs.
  - **FLUX.1 Pro**：Closed-source model, providing the best performance, suitable for commercial applications. Currently, you can only use it through the API, or use the application that calls this API. 
  - **[FLUX.1 Dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)**：Open-source model, not for commercial use, distilled from the Pro version, with similar image quality and prompt following capabilities, but more efficient.
  - **[FLUX.1 Schnell](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell)**：Open-source model, based on the Apache 2.0 license, designed for local development and personal use, with the fastest generation speed and the smallest memory footprint.

### 1.2 Model Architecture and Differences

Flux model is based on the Diffusion Transformer architecture, which is different from the mainstream Stable Diffusion model architecture. In the subsequent part of this chapter, I will introduce the Flux model architecture in detail. Because Flux uses a new architecture, it outperforms popular models such as Midjourney v6.0, DALL-E 3 (HD), and SD3-Ultra in the following aspects: 
- Visual Quality
- Prompt Following
- Size/Aspect Variability
- Typography
- Output Diversity

And FLUX.1 [schnell] outperforms similar open-source models such as SD3-Turbo and SDXL-Lightning in terms of performance. The comparison results are shown below:

### 1.3 Usage Methods

Flux model can be used in the following ways:
  - **API**：Through the API, such as Black Forest Labs official [BFL API](https://docs.bfl.ml/).
  - **Flux Application**：In addition to local calls, Flux models can also be used in some applications. For example, [Comflowy](https://comflowy.com/) provides Flux applications for various versions. If your computer performance is not good, or you cannot install ComfyUI, you can consider using this method. You can go to the [Flux Application](https://comflowy.com/flux) page to learn and use Flux applications.
  - **Local Call**：You can also use Flux models through ComfyUI on your local computer. If you are not interested in the implementation principles of Flux models, you can directly refer to the following section to learn how to use Flux models in ComflyUI:

## 2. Flux Model Implementation Principles

<Note>
  If you don't want to understand the implementation principles of Flux models, you can skip this chapter. Also, I recommend that you first understand the architecture of the Stable Diffusion model before you understand the architecture of the Flux model. You can refer to this tutorial: [Stable Diffusion Model Foundation](https://comflowy.com/basics/stable-diffusion-foundation).

### 2.1 Review Stable Diffusion Model Architecture

As mentioned earlier, the Flux model architecture is different from the Stable Diffusion model architecture, based on the Diffusion Transformer architecture. So, before introducing the Flux model architecture, I will briefly introduce the overall framework of the Stable Diffusion model first.

First, the user inputs text instructions, which will be converted to word vectors by the Text Encoder, and then these word vectors will be sent to the Image Information Creator together with the Random Image data. After a series of denoising loops, the image data will be obtained, and finally, these data will be converted to human-readable images by the Decoder.

    src="/images/basics/flux-model/stable-diffusion-framework-dark.png"
    alt="Stable Diffusion Dark"
  />
</Frame>

The process in Image Information Creator is a denoising loop. If we use the analogy method to explain, this process is like the sculptor carving the marble. The parts that are not needed are removed, and the remaining part is the sculpture consistent with the instruction:

<Frame>

    className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/stable-diffusion-denoise-dark.png"
    alt="Stable Diffusion Denoise Dark"
  />
</Frame>

If we make it more concrete, the whole process will be a gradual process of a random image becoming clearer:

    className="rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/stable-diffusion-denoise-process.png"
    alt="Stable Diffusion Denoise Process Light"
  />
</Frame>

The whole process has two points to pay attention to.

① During the denoising process, a module called Noise Predictor is used to predict the noise.

This Noise Predictor is actually a U-Net model. The whole process can be understood as the computer first compresses the data, and then puts it into the corresponding data. As shown in the figure below, because its schematic diagram looks like a U, it is called U-Net.

    src="/images/basics/flux-model/u-net-architecture.png"
    alt="U-Net Architecture"
  />
</Frame>

② Another point to pay attention to is that during the denoising process, Stable Diffusion uses a technique called CFG to amplify the parameters related to the Prompt. At the same time, users can also remove unwanted things through Negative Prompt.

### 2.2 Flux Model Key Changes

After understanding the Stable Diffusion model, let's look at the implementation of Flux. The biggest difference between Flux and Stable Diffusion is that Flux is a DiT (Diffusion Transformer) model. The key difference of the DiT model is that it replaces the U-Net in the original Diffusion model with Transformer. 

I will use the following diagram to explain it. In terms of the overall framework, Flux is similar to Stable Diffusion, with Text Encoder, Image Information Creator, and Image Decoder. But you can see that it has some additional components, such as T5 Encoder and Linear Projector.

#### 2.2.1 Diffusion Transformer

First, let's understand the Linear Projector. This step is to convert two-dimensional Latent data into one-dimensional Token data. Why do we need to do this? Because in the subsequent denoising process (as shown in Figure ④), the DiT model does not predict the noise of the entire image as in the original U-Net. Instead, it denoises in blocks. If we visualize this process, it will look like the following:

<Info>Note, I made the figure to show the denoising process, so it's a visible image. In actuality, the model's situation is a one-dimensional number, and the number needs to be converted to a visible image through Image Decoder.</Info>

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-denoise-light.png"
    alt="Flux Model Denoise Light"

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-denoise-dark.png"
    alt="Flux Model Denoise Dark"
  />
</Frame>

First, the Linear Projector will divide the data into blocks and mark them, recording the position and order of each block. As shown in the figure. Then, when predicting the noise, it will start from left to right (as shown in Figure ①). At the same time, when predicting, it will also carry the data of the previous figure for prediction. For example, when predicting the fourth block, the model will carry the data of the first, second, and third blocks for prediction.

Then, after predicting from left to right, it will be predicted from left to right again (as shown in Figure ②), after multiple rounds of prediction, the final image data will be obtained.

After multiple rounds of denoising, the Linear Projector will concatenate these one-dimensional Token data into two-dimensional Latent data, and then pass them through the Image Decoder to become human-readable images:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-image-decoder-light.png"
    alt="Flux Model Image Decoder Light"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-image-decoder-dark.png"
    alt="Flux Model Image Decoder Dark"
  />
</Frame>

There are several benefits to this:

1. The U-Net model compresses and amplifies data when predicting noise, and some data may be lost during this process. However, using this Transformer approach, the possibility of data loss is greatly reduced. Therefore, Flux model generates more detailed images than Stable Diffusion model.
2. In addition, due to the forward attention mechanism of Transformer, when predicting noise, it can carry the data of the previous figure for prediction, so Flux model has better image continuity than Stable Diffusion model. It will not appear that there is an object that does not exist in a certain position.

#### 2.2.2 T5 Encoder

Besides the Linear Projector, T5 Encoder is also a key change in the Flux model. T5 Encoder is a text encoder based on the T5 model architecture, which converts text instructions into word vectors that the model can understand. Then these word vectors will be sent to the Linear Projector together with the Latent Image data to be converted into one-dimensional Token data. At the same time, these data will also be Concat  to be used as the input of the denoising loop. The visualized process is as follows:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-t5-encoder-light.png"
    alt="Flux Model T5 Encoder Light"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block rounded-xl"
    src="/images/basics/flux-model/flux-model-t5-encoder-dark.png"
    alt="Flux Model T5 Encoder Dark"
  />
</Frame>

If we still use the analogy of sculpture, converting Prompt into word vectors, and then Concat to the Latent Image data, it is equivalent to the sculptor no longer carving the standard marble, but carving the marble similar to the Prompt. For example, if the Prompt is to carve a character, the Stable Diffusion model will describe the character according to the Prompt, and then carve a standard cube of marble into a character. While Flux model will choose a marble similar to the character for carving. The benefits are obvious, the sculpture will be more consistent with the Prompt.

This is why Flux model has better prompt following capabilities than Stable Diffusion model.

#### 2.2.3 Other Changes

Besides the above two changes, another change is that Flux model is a guidance distilled model. During the denoising process, it no longer uses the CFG technology. The biggest benefit is that the model does not need to predict twice (predict once with Prompt, and predict once without Prompt), so the generation speed is faster.

At the same time, when using Flux model, you no longer need to input Negative Prompt. This also reduces the possibility of the two groups of Positive Prompt and Negative Prompt competing with each other. For example, if you add "ugly hands" to the Negative Prompt, you may get fewer ugly hands, or it may just make any hands that appear more deformed, so they are no longer considered hands.


## 2.3 Flux's Future

Finally, let's predict the future development direction of Flux model based on its architecture, and why Flux is worth learning and using.

First, due to the DiT architecture, Flux model will not only be able to generate images in the future, but also videos (of course, the new model may not be called Flux).

Second, due to the T5 Encoder, Flux model has a significant improvement in prompt following capabilities. And when the model Concatenates data, it is the Tokenized data that is Concatenated together, so we can try to use the reference image as input in the future to achieve more interesting controls.
