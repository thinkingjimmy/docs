ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my friend. 

This tutorial is a beginner's tutorial for Flux, aiming to help you get started with Flux quickly. The author of this tutorial is not directly related to Black Forest Labs. 

It is supported by [Comflowy](https://www.comflowy.com/).

## Basics
This part will mainly introduce the basic knowledge of the model, so that you can better understand the Flux model later. After completing this basic part, you can use ComfyUI to build a basic Flux workflow and use text-to-image to output all kinds of images.

## Intermediate

After completing the basic course, you may not be satisfied with the generated images, such as:

- You are not satisfied with some parts of the generated images and want to modify them.
- You want to strengthen the control over the generation process, such as controlling the pose of the characters in the image.

The intermediate course will introduce more methods to help you solve the above problems. Completing the intermediate course means you can control the model's output relatively accurately.
